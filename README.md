## Description

This is my second homework for the University of Denver Web Development Boot Camp! It's the basic framework of what will become my portfolio page for all the projects and applications I build.

## Deployment

The code (and associated assets) are hosted right here in this GitHub repository, and it's all live on the web thanks to GitHub pages. If you would like to check it out, you can view the site at the link below:

 ## Credits
 
 This project was made using Bootstrap, HTML, and CSS.
